These individuals, a rather inquisitive bunch, seemed to be quite the genius scholars, or whatever such pursuits are called on the other side, who somehow brought themselves to this land.\n\nThe incident is unlikely to repeat itself. As far as the land is concerned, no one aside from Chime has laid eyes on them. I suspect he followed me into the heart of the forest, where I first encountered these peculiar intruders. However, the actual event transpired within the crypt, and I made sure that no one could access there."
    new "　　提醒了我八臂鬼，由八个幽灵组成的集体意识。这个集体意识具有浓厚的好奇心，并且有迹象表明他们同时还具有高超的智识。这些异世界里所谓的“学者”，不知怎么就来到了这片土地。这起事件不太可能重演。在这片大陆上，除了齐门外没有人见过他们。我怀疑他跟着我进入了森林深处，正是在那里，我第一次遇到了这些奇特的穿越者。不过，事件发生的真实地点在地下陵墓，除了我没人能进去，我可以保证。"

    old "Speaking of the scholars, they appeared to be affiliated with a tribe — a group of investigators seeking to trace the lost sprites that escaped during the Ookko incident. It seems they made contact with the runes, likely the reason for their journey to our tribe. Fortunately, magic has no influence here, allowing me to extract some information before their banishment.\n\nAll in all, I cannot let the scholars leave, so I opted to sever their ability to communicate instead. At least, some natural instincts of these poor souls remains manifested in the shape of their hands, consider them bane of the pesky sprites from now on."
    new "　　至于那些学者，他们所属的部落正大力追踪在乌克事件中逃脱的幽魂。看来他们与符文有过接触，这可能就是他们来到我们部落的原因。好在这里不会被魔法影响，我得以在他们被放逐之前获取一些信息。总而言之，我不能让这些学者离开，所以我得切断他们的交流能力。不过这些可怜灵魂的某些自然本能仍会以手的形式显现出来，今后就把他们视为那些烦人幽魂的克星吧。"

    old "Now, the crux of the matter: I gleaned from the scholars that they were in pursuit of him, motive is still unknown, unless we fall back on their own curiosity. While they proved to be nothing but a chore, they are not my primary concern. What troubles me is that the passage towards our tribe may have been known from outside. I fear that the next time someone traverses that passage, I might not have caught them in time.\n\nRegardless, those on the other side should make a better effort to ensure that does not happen again, I should not have been the only one taking care of the mess. The potential consequences could be catastrophic to them if a malicious outsider somehow made contact"
    new "　　现在问题的关键是：从学者那里我知道他们在追踪他，但还不清楚动机，除非我们将其归结为他们的好奇心。最让我担忧的不是学者，他们顶多处理起来有点麻烦——而是通往我们部族的通道可能已经为外界所知，下次再有谁通过通道时我可能来不及抓住他们。不管怎样，对面的人应该更加努力确保这种情况不再发生。这次不该只有我来善后，毕竟如果某个恶意的外来者与我们部族接触，对他们来说后果将是灾难性的。\n\n　　　　　　　　　　佩克欧"
